## Manual Build 

> ðŸ‘‰ Download the code  

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/django-material-dashboard-pro.git
$ cd django-material-dashboard-pro
```

<br />

> Export `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment. The value is provided by AppSeed during purchase. 

This is required because the project has a private REPO dependency: `github.com/app-generator/priv-django-admin-material-pro`

```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'  # for Linux, Mac
$ set GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'     # Windows CMD
$ $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'TOKEN_HERE'  # Windows powerShell 
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Install modules via `VENV`.


```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Edit the `.env` using the template `.env.sample`. 

```env

# True for development, False for production
DEBUG=True

```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Create the Superuser

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## How to Customize 

When a template file is loaded in the controller, `Django` scans all template directories starting from the ones defined by the user, and returns the first match or an error in case the template is not found. 
The  theme used to style this starter provides the following files: 

```bash
< LIBRARY_ROOT >                     # This exists in ENV: LIB/admin_material_pro
   |
   |-- templates/                    # Root Templates Folder 
   |    |          
   |    |-- accounts/       
   |    |    |-- login.html          # Sign IN Page
   |    |    |-- register.html       # Sign UP Page
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/       
   |    |    |-- footer.html         # Footer component
   |    |    |-- sidebar.html        # Sidebar component
   |    |    |-- navigation.html     # Navigation Bar
   |    |    |-- scripts.html        # Scripts Component
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/       
   |    |    |-- base.html           # Masterpage
   |    |    |-- base-auth.html      # Masterpage for Auth Pages
   |    |
   |    |-- pages/       
   |         |-- dashboard.html      # Dashboard Page
   |         |-- widgets.html        # Widgets Page
   |         |-- calendar.html       # Calendar page
   |         |-- *.html              # All other pages
   |    
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

When our project requires customization, we need to copy the original file (from the virtual environment) and place it in the template folder using the same path. 

For instance, the `HOME/templates` directory is shipped with a customized footer: `includes\custom_footer.html`. 
By default, this file is unused because the `theme` expects `includes\footer.html`. 

In order to use it, simply rename it to `includes\footer.html` and overwrite it like this the default version shipped in the library:

`<YOUR Virtual ENV>/LIB/admin_material_pro/includes\footer.html`

In a similar way, all other files and components can be customized as well.

<br />

## Deploy on [Render](https://render.com/)

  - Go to https://dashboard.render.com/blueprints this link.
- Click `New Blueprint Instance` button.
- Connect your `repo` which you want to deploy.
- Fill the `Service Group Name` and click on `Update Existing Resources` button.
- After that your deployment will start automatically.

At this point, the product should be LIVE.
